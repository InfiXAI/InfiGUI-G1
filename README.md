  <strong>InfiGUI-G1 enhances GUI grounding with Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO) to overcome exploration bottlenecks.</strong>
</p>

## üåü Overview

A fundamental challenge for GUI agents is robustly grounding natural language instructions, which requires not only precise **spatial alignment** (locating elements accurately) but also correct **semantic alignment** (identifying the functionally appropriate element). While existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods have enhanced spatial precision, they often suffer from inefficient exploration. This "confidence trap" bottlenecks semantic alignment, preventing models from discovering correct actions for difficult semantic associations.

To address this critical exploration problem, we introduce **InfiGUI-G1**, a series of models trained with **Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO)**. AEPO overcomes the exploration bottleneck by integrating a **multi-answer generation** strategy to explore a diverse set of candidate actions in a single forward pass. This exploration is guided by a theoretically-grounded **Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER)** function, derived from first principles of efficiency ($\eta=U/C$), which provides rich, informative learning signals to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation.

## üìä Results

Our InfiGUI-G1 models, trained with the AEPO framework, establish new state-of-the-art results among open-source models across a diverse and challenging set of GUI grounding benchmarks.

### MMBench-GUI (L2) Results

On the comprehensive MMBench-GUI benchmark, which evaluates performance across various platforms and instruction complexities, our InfiGUI-G1 models establish new state-of-the-art results for open-source models in their respective size categories.

### ScreenSpot-Pro Results

On the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, designed to test semantic understanding on high-resolution professional software, InfiGUI-G1 demonstrates significant improvements, particularly on icon-based grounding tasks. This highlights AEPO's effectiveness in enhancing semantic alignment by associating abstract visual symbols with their functions.

### UI-Vision (Element Grounding) Results

InfiGUI-G1 shows strong generalization capabilities on the UI-Vision benchmark, which is designed to test robustness across a wide variety of unseen desktop applications. Achieving high performance confirms that our AEPO framework fosters a robust understanding rather than overfitting to the training data.

### UI-I2E-Bench Results

To further probe semantic reasoning, we evaluated on UI-I2E-Bench, a benchmark featuring a high proportion of implicit instructions that require reasoning beyond direct text matching. Our model's strong performance underscores AEPO's ability to handle complex, indirect commands.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation

This section provides instructions for reproducing the evaluation results reported in our paper.

### 1. Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InfiXAI/InfiGUI-G1.git
cd InfiGUI-G1
```

### 2. Environment Setup

The evaluation pipeline is built upon the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) library for efficient inference. For detailed installation guidance, please refer to the official vLLM repository. The specific versions used to obtain the results reported in our paper are as follows:

- **Python**: `3.10.12`
- **PyTorch**: `2.6.0`
- **Transformers**: `4.50.1`
- **vLLM**: `0.8.2`
- **CUDA**: `12.6`

The reported results were obtained on a server equipped with 4 x NVIDIA H800 GPUs.

### 3. Model Download

Download the InfiGUI-G1 models from the Hugging Face Hub into the `./models` directory.

```bash
# Create a directory for models
mkdir -p ./models

# Download InfiGUI-G1-3B
huggingface-cli download --resume-download InfiX-ai/InfiGUI-G1-3B --local-dir ./models/InfiGUI-G1-3B

# Download InfiGUI-G1-7B
huggingface-cli download --resume-download InfiX-ai/InfiGUI-G1-7B --local-dir ./models/InfiGUI-G1-7B
```

### 4. Dataset Download and Preparation

Download the required evaluation benchmarks into the `./data` directory.

```bash
# Create a directory for datasets
mkdir -p ./data

# Download benchmarks
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download likaixin/ScreenSpot-Pro --local-dir ./data/ScreenSpot-Pro
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download ServiceNow/ui-vision --local-dir ./data/ui-vision
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download OS-Copilot/ScreenSpot-v2 --local-dir ./data/ScreenSpot-v2
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download OpenGVLab/MMBench-GUI --local-dir ./data/MMBench-GUI
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download vaundys/I2E-Bench --local-dir ./data/I2E-Bench
```

After downloading, some datasets require unzipping compressed image files.

```bash
# Unzip images for ScreenSpot-v2
unzip ./data/ScreenSpot-v2/screenspotv2_image.zip -d ./data/ScreenSpot-v2/

# Unzip images for MMBench-GUI
unzip ./data/MMBench-GUI/MMBench-GUI-OfflineImages.zip -d ./data/MMBench-GUI/
```

### 5. Running the Evaluation

To run the evaluation, use the `eval/eval.py` script. You must specify the path to the model, the benchmark name, and the tensor parallel size.

Here is an example command to evaluate the `InfiGUI-G1-3B` model on the `screenspot-pro` benchmark using 4 GPUs:

```bash
python eval/eval.py \
    ./models/InfiGUI-G1-3B \
    --benchmark screenspot-pro \
    --tensor-parallel 4
```

- **`model_path`**: The first positional argument specifies the path to the downloaded model directory (e.g., `./models/InfiGUI-G1-3B`).
- **`--benchmark`**: Specifies the benchmark to evaluate. Available options include `screenspot-pro`, `screenspot-v2`, `ui-vision`, `mmbench-gui`, and `i2e-bench`.
- **`--tensor-parallel`**: Sets the tensor parallelism size, which should typically match the number of available GPUs.

Evaluation results, including detailed logs and performance metrics, will be saved to the `./output/{model_name}/{benchmark}/` directory.
